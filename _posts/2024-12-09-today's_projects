Here is the pi and the INA219 on the breadboard during testing.

I made more permanent connections and used a butter bowl as a protective case.

The wires are held in place through the hole with hot glue. And here is a top down look into the bowl

I needed a bigger can to hold coals from the stove. I was buying green beans anyway and they had this huge can on sale for $2.74.

No way could I eat all those at once, so I mexed in some onions and re-canned them into smaller portions. Now you can see I have a new stove coal can.

Having a good supply of stove coals is essential for starting fires quickly. A propane torch and about 30 seconds will get those coals going and witihin 5 minutes the fire will start. In another 15 minutes the fire will be roaring at full blast. And since I have no clean out trap on the little stove, those bigger cans are also usefull for holding hot ash and coals until the ash can be sifted for more coals.

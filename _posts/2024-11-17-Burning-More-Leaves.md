Burning more leaves today. The incinerator is still working. The leaves burnt quite a bit faster today after they had a chance to dry out for another 2 days.

These images were captured with the old red phone I've been keeping in my pocket. The rubber band trick is working pretty good. I raked and loaded all those leaves and also cut and split fire wood and the phone did not slip out of the shirt pocket a single time. 

That phone takes decent images. The file sizes on these images is also considerably smaller so they should hopefully load faster.
